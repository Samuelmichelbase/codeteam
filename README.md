# R&D team recruitment

Need to develop an Android app, required to be online within 3 weeks, now recruiting R & D team.

The main requirements are as follows：
 1. The app is bilingual in Chinese and English, and users can switch freely.
 2. New users will be given 100,000 computing power for registration.
 3. Registration requires email address, handheld photo ID and handwritten signature.
 4. The home page requires a graph of the whole network's computing power, the user's own computing power and its share of the network.
 5. The app includes an invitation mechanism. Every time an old user invites a new user to register, can get 100,000 computing power.
 6. The user can view the list of all the subordinate users invited and their profile photo，but other information is not viewable.
 7. Announcements can be sent, view in message list.

All R & D teams are welcome to apply, evaluate and quote.
